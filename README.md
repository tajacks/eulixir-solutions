# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for Project Euler puzzles, up to the 100th puzzle. Project Euler does not wish for solutions outside the first 100 to be shared if it can be helped.

The boilerplate for each puzzle is generated using Eulixir, my puzzle helper.

To run or benchmark my solutions, check out the documentation in the [Eulixir](https://github.com/tajacks/eulixir) repository.

Not all puzzle solutions (read: hardly any) are present.
